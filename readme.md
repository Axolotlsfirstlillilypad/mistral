By following these methodologies and incorporating a comprehensive approach to analysis, you can offer predictive insights and strategic guidance on the commodities market, enabling informed decision-making and risk mitigation strategies.





Overall my code takes data from a prepared csv I have obtained by web-scraping. Then splitting the dataset into test and train, before applying a simple Linear Regression model. It is also possible to apply further GB to improve accuracy
